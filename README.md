# Udacity-Diff-Equ-in-Action
Some modules made while completing Udacity's course Differential Equations in Action<br>
Lesson 1 is mainly review of concepts.<br>
Lesson 2 is Apollo 13 model (includes Forward Euler method and Heun's method). Final project from Lesson 2 is in file diffequ15.py<br>
Lesson 3 is infectious diseases model (includes Forward Euler, Backward Euler and Trapezoidal methods).<br>
Lesson 4 is responsible fishing model.<br>
Lesson 5 is model of Anti-lock Braking System.<br>
Lesson 6 is model of spread of a wildfire (uses partial differential equations). Final project from Lesson 6 is in file diffequ38.py and includes heat diffusion, heat loss, wind, and diffusion in model.<br>
Lesson 7: Advanced Applications of Numerical Methods. Includes model of hanging rope using Finite Element Method and model of incompressible liquid between a layer of constant high temperature and a layer of constant low temperature using the Lorenz System (with Forward Euler method).
